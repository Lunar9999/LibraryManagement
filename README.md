# Library Management System

This project is a simple Library Management System built using Flask. This README will guide you through the installation process and how to get the project up and running, as well as how to test the "Hello, World!" route.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
    cd library-management-system
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    - On Windows:
      ```sh
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:

## Running the Project

**Run the Flask application:**
